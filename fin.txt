The analysis of sentences and their translation
	The accuracy of translation from English into Russian depends not only on understanding the gramma constractions of the English language but also on the ability to analyze sentence correctly. This ability allow primarily define the members of the proposal, then parts of speech, which determined by the place in the sentence and, depending on the part of the speeches, find correct and accurate translation of the word. it should be remembered that the translation of a word always depends on the context, on the function of the word in the sentence.
	In English, a simple declarative common sentence, excluding emphatic sentences, usually has a definite stable word order.Due to this stability, each member of the sentence takes a certain place, designated by us conventionally by a Roman numeral.This stable word order is due to the small number of grammatical inflections in the English language, which cannot express all the word connections in a sentence.
